                <h2>Ask our Patients: </h2>

                <ul>

                <li><p>“Mary Beth is one of the few physical therapists that is just as remarkable treating chronic pain as she is providing rehabilitation after surgery.   After separate surgeries on my back and my knee, she was able to help me regain my strength and mobility back to normal. Her natural instincts, experience, and ability to narrow down the real source of a problem make her one of the best physical therapists you will find.” — Darlene H.</p></li>


                <li><p>“Friends kept telling me that Mary Beth is ‘the best’ and I should go see her.  Then my doctor also told me she was the best and referred me to her for head, neck and TMJ pain.  She really IS the best!!!  Every week she not only worked hard to find the areas that caused pain but relieved that pain AND taught me ways to relieve the pain (or lessen it) on my own.  I can’t imagine ever going to another therapist again.  I feel so, so much better than the 1st day I came in!” — Lisa B.</p></li>



                <li><p>"Mary Beth provides a perfect blend of deep muscle massage, and stretching/strengthening. She is amazingly good at identifying the root causes of pains and restrictions in movement - especially with the very complicated shoulder issues I had. An orthopedic surgeon told me I had 2 choices: surgery, or 'live with it'. TBR was a much better alternative than either of these! Thanks!" — Tom R.</p></li>



                <li><p>“Mary Beth really cares about her patients, and takes the time necessary to understand each person’s situation...resulting in a holistic approach. I would not trust my physical therapy needs with anyone else! Thank you Total Body Rehab.” — Julie L.</p></li>


                <li><p>"I was very impressed with Mary Beth's ability to read my body and know just what was needed to help bring me into balance. Her holistic tool box of cranial sacral massage, Pilates and intuition are a huge compliment to her physical therapy work. I am so glad I found her!" — Ginny Y.</p></li>


                <li><p>“I have made the rounds of physical therapy practices in the Triangle and have not achieved relief from neck and shoulder problems until working with Mary Beth.  I now am pain free and have stretches and exercises to maintain my improved health.  I highly recommend Total Body Rehab.”— Emily W.</p></li>



                <li><p>"Mary Beth enabled me to recover from my shoulder problem in record time. She took care to see that I had the necessary exercises to continue on my own to maintain good health. I was grateful for the professionalism of Total Body Rehab, and appreciate their helpfulness in working appointments around my complicated schedule." — Elizabeth T. </p></li>


                <li><p>“Mary Beth goes the extra mile by educating me as we go through various exercises and she has really empowered me to continue my rehab at home on my own.  She cares so deeply for her patients and is obviously passionate about her profession.  What would have been very painful therapy became much more enjoyable, thanks to Mary Beth!”  — Danielle L.</p></li>


                <li><p>“Mary Beth is in a category by herself!  She’s extremely knowledgeable, up-to-date on the latest advances, has the desire to help her patients improve, she thinks ‘out of the box’ when she needs to and she knows hat her talents have been bestowed on her from God.  She’s wonderful!” — Phyllis Y.</p></li>


                <li><p>“Mary Beth has incredible knowledge about how the body works and the skill and persistence to go far beyond what I have experienced with other physical therapists. I am thrilled with the progress we made on solving a long term problem with my foot/leg/hip/pelvis. After many years of just addressing and soothing symptoms, I feel like my work with Mary Beth has helped my finally make a dent on the underlying problems.” - Betty A.</p></li>


                <li><p>“Mary Beth is a detective, a bulldog and a miracle worker all rolled into one.  I am much better off having spent a few weeks with her.” - Diana  L.</p></li>


                <li><p>“I have been going to TBR for a couple of months now and I am so pleased with the care I have received from Mary Beth Klemm.  I am 41 years old and have never needed physical therapy until this year when I was in a car accident.  At first, I went to a different physical therapy facility to begin my treatment.  After 2 months of therapy there, I was not improving, and in some ways, feeling worse.  Then my doctor recommended I try Total Body Rehab and what a difference!   The time, attention, and effort that she put into my recovery was 100%.  After just several visits, I could already notice an improvement with my pain.  I have  now had successful completion to my treatments and I am so thrilled with the care that Mary Beth, as well as her office staff, has shown me.  TBR is as wonderful as my doctor told me, and I would whole-heartedly recommend her to anyone who is in need of physical therapy!” - Cheryl P.</p></li>


                <li><p>“When I started therapy at TBR, I could barely move; was in a lot of pain; and, my spirits were very low.  I thought I would never get back to my pre-injury days.  Mary Beth is truly a professional.  I am very impressed with her knowledge.  She was able to help me recover and educate me to prevent a relapse.  I am more aware of how my body works and able to make adjustments in movement to correct old and bad habits.  I have resumed my fitness regime, and have a new appreciation for what my body can do!  Thanks Mary Beth.” - Kelly P.</p></li>


                <li><p>“Total Body Relief!” - Ken M.</p></li>




                <li><p>“Mary Beth knows the human body, how it works and how ti fix things that aren’t working.  She has proven to me more than once that she knows how to diagnose and treat inter-related problems.  I highly recommend her!” - Linda  J.</p></li>



                <li><p>“The therapy I received here was just what I needed.  It gave me back my mobility, circulation, and a painfree life.  The staff was friendly, warm and professional.  I enjoyed my visits. And I know that I have been given the tools I need to prevent my issues from reoccurring.  Thank You!”  ~Shari F.</p></li>




                <li><p>“Awesome.  Mary Beth found my problem and worked with me til I could take care of myself.  I had suffered with low back pain for over a year and could not sit for long periods of time and I had to modify my daily activities to function.  Now I can carry out daily activities normally.”  — Jill R.</p></li>



                <li><p>“When I first came to Total Body Rehab, I had shoulder/arm/hand pain that made me want to cry when doing simple things like typing or cleaning a cat’s litter box. Mary Beth worked methodically through my pain to determine not only how to relieve the pain, but the root cause of the pain.  Mary Beth won’t give up until she finds the cause of your pain. She works so hard to make you feel better, giving an entire hour of therapy when friends of mine (going to another physical therapist) are getting only twenty minutes. I think Mary Beth is a miracle worker, and I can’t say enough good things about her and Total Body Rehab!” — Diane O.</p></li>
