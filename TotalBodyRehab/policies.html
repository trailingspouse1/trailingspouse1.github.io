                <h3>Payment Policy</h3> 
                <p>Thank you for choosing Total Body Rehab for your health care needs. Our goal is to provide you with the finest physical therapy treatment available. Following the initial evaluation, your Physical Therapist will talk to you about your Plan of Care, which will include the frequency and duration of visits necessary to treat your specific condition. </p>
                <p>We will be happy to file claims with your insurance company. It is important for you to understand that a verbal explanation of benefits does not guarantee payment from your insurance company and you are ultimately responsible for all charges with Total Body Rehab.</p> 
                <p>We also accept cash payments per session.</p>

                <h3>Missed Appointments </h3>
                <p>It is very important that you keep your appointments. If you must cancel, please contact our office immediately so we can reschedule you and make that time slot available for another patient. Since we are atypical to other clinics in scheduling patients once every hour, it is imperative that we have advanced notification so we could offer it to someone else in need of an appointment. You will be charged a $40.00 “no-show” fee if you fail to give a 24-hour notice of your cancelled appointment. In an emergency, we may waive the “no-show” fee, but this will be determined on a per incident basis. </p>

                <h3>Returned Checks </h3>
                <p>A $25.00 fee will be charged if your bank returns a check. </p>
                <p>Missed Appointments and Returned Check fees are due before your next appointment and are the patient’s responsibility. Insurance companies will not provide reimbursement for these types of charges.</p>

I have been given useful exercises, which work, and find that there are definitely more good days than bad. Thank you, Kelley, for your patience and guidance. Of the many PTs I’ve seen, you’ve been the best. Thank you!" </blockquote></p>
