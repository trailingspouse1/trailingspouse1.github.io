            <h3>Mary Beth Klemm, PT</h3>
            <p><img class="img-responsive" src="images/marybeth.png" width="200px" align="left" alt="Mary Beth Klemm, Physical Therapist" hspace="20">The owner of Total Body Rehab, Mary Beth is a licensed physical therapist who just celebrated her 34th year in the physical therapy profession.  Mary Beth brings an eclectic approach to TBR with a strong focus on manual treatment.</p>

            <p>She received her undergraduate degree at Montclair State University in New Jersey and earned her degree in Physical Therapy at the University of Pennsylvania in 1980.</p>

            <p>Mary Beth has extensive experience in orthopedics and sports medicine, both in the hospital and private outpatient settings, and has worked as a physical therapist in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and North Carolina. <p>

            <p>Mary Beth’s continuing education has focused on many classes with Paul St. John Neuromuscular Therapy Pain Relief for the extremities, neck, low back, and jaw musculature. She has also taken extensive courses for the treatment of spinal dysfunction and SI joint dysfunction with Mulligan, Maitland, and Dontigney. Mary Beth is well versed in Myofascial Trigger Point release and was fortunate to take a course with the late Janet Travell, MD, and has recently studied under Jan Dommerholt, PT through the Myopain Seminars for Dry Needling for Myofascial Trigger Point pain. This compliments her coursework with John Barnes, PT for Myofascial Release Techniques and Craniosacral Therapy through the Upledger Institute. She has taken extensive coursework for treatment of the shoulder and neck, foot, knee-hip kinetic chain, sacroiliac and lumbopelvic dysfunction, and temporomandibular dysfunction including chronic headaches and migraine headaches. Mary Beth is also a certified Pilates Instructor and incorporates core strengthening and flexibility dynamics into her treatment. Mary Beth focuses on the biochemical forces of the body and how disruption of the normal kinesis of motion leads to pain and dysfunction. She is a firm believer in comprehensive patient education to help patients maintain progress log after they have been discharged from physical therapy.</p>

            <p>Mary Beth grew up in Clifton, NJ and relocated to Cary in 2000. She worked in two local private physical therapy practices before opening Total Body Rehab in February of 2003.

                <p> <blockquote>“When I first came to Total Body Rehab, I had shoulder/arm/hand pain that made me want to cry when doing simple things like typing or cleaning a cat’s litter box. Mary Beth worked methodically through my pain to determine not only how to relieve the pain, but the root cause of the pain.  Mary Beth won’t give up until she finds the cause of your pain. She works so hard to make you feel better, giving an entire hour of therapy when friends of mine (going to another physical therapist) are getting only twenty minutes. I think Mary Beth is a miracle worker, and I can’t say enough good things about her and Total Body Rehab!” — Diane O.
